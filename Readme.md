Responsiveness
This project is designed to work smoothly across different devices and screen sizes:

Mobile-friendly layout
1.Responsive input fields and buttons
2.Flexible containers using CSS Flexbox and Media Queries
3.We did not use any CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap. All responsiveness is handled manually with plain CSS.

Positive Outcomes:-
1.Improved usability with PDF exports
2.Real-time data integration through APIs
3.Mobile friendly design as this website is responsivve.

Areas to Improve:
1.Could enhance styling using the Tailwind CSS in future
2.Add charts or graphs for better visual feedback for the users in the investment and debt features.
3.More styling can be added to the exported pdf's as they are simple only basic information is there and can add things to make it like proffesional printable results.
